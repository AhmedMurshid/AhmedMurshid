This project involved developing and testing a hybrid GA+WoC algorithm in Python, aiming to find the shortest closed path that visits every edge of a graph. The solution has practical applications in route optimization and logistics. Extensive experiments were conducted to ensure the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, including the development of a GUI for visual representation of algorithmic solutions.",
