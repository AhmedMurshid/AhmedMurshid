                <p>Humans have four main types of teeth, each with its unique function:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Incisors</strong> - Designed for cutting and slicing food.</li>
                    <li><strong>Canines</strong> - Pointed teeth beside the incisors, used for tearing and gripping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Premolars</strong> - Flat-topped teeth for crushing and grinding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Molars</strong> - Larger flat teeth at the back of the mouth, used for grinding food.</li>
                </ul>
